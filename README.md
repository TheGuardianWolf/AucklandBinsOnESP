# Auckland Bins on ESP32

Want to know what days to put your bins out? We'll have you covered.

This can use the inbuilt-led to flash a code so you know what days to put your bins out!

Alternatively, connect more LEDs to have a colourful reference :D

If this breaks, then the Auckland Council's website has changed. We'll try to maintain it best we
can.
